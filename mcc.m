% R = matthewscorr(true_label, predicted_label)
%
% computes the 'Matthews correlation coefficient' as described on Wikipedia
% (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthews_correlation_coefficient)
%
% It's supposedly a special correlation coefficient for binary data (e.g.
% in binary classification) and computes the correlation based on true and
% false postivies and negatives, but the correlation coefficients seem to
% be the same as those computed by Matlab's corrcoef.
